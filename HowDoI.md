## Get Started

### <a name="set-up-input-in-a-blank-project"></a>... set up input in a blank project?

1. Install the input system package through the Unity Package Manager as per [the documentation](Installation.md).
   ![Installation](Images/HowDoI/Installation.gif)
   This adds the [`UnityEngine.InputSystem`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.html) API to your project and enables support for it in the native Unity runtime.<br><br>
2. Add a [`PlayerInput`](Components.md#playerinput-component) to a `GameObject`.
   ![Add Player](Images/HowDoI/AddPlayer.gif)
   This adds an [`.inputactions`](ActionAssets.md) asset to your project and sets up one player in the game to use those actions.<br><br>
3. Read input from the actions in script.
   ![Read Input](Images/HowDoI/ReadInput.gif)
   ```CSharp
   public class CharacterController : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public InputActionReference fire;
       public InputActionReference move;

       public void Update()
       {
           if (fire.action.WasPressedThisFrame())
               Fire();

           var moveVector = move.action.ReadValue<Vector2>();
           Move(moveVector);
       }

       //...
   }
   ```
   There are other ways in which input from the actions can be consumed. For details, see the documentation for [`PlayerInput`](Components.md#playerinput-component) and [actions](Actions.md).

////TODO: problem: above script doesn't work as is for local multiplayer

### <a name="set-up-ugui-to-work-with-the-input-system"></a> ... set up uGUI to work with the input system?

Go to the `EventSystem` object and click the "Replace with InputSystemUIInputModule" button. Optionally, to use your own bindings instead of the default ones, drag your custom `.inputactions` asset into the `Actions Asset` field.

![Setup UI](Images/HowDoI/SetupUI.gif)

This will set up uGUI to receive events generated from input defined in an [`.inputactions`](ActionAssets.md) asset. If needed, you can customize the bindings.

### <a name="keep-using-the-old-input-system-alongside-the-new-one"></a> ... keep using the old input system alongside the new one?

After [installation](Installation.md), set `Active Input Handling` in `Player Preferences` to `Both`.

![Use Old and New](Images/HowDoI/UseOldAndNew.gif)

## Players

### <a name="have-multiple-players-in-my-game"></a> ... have multiple players in my game?

Each [`PlayerInput`](Components.md#playerinput-component) represents one player. Having more than one `GameObject` with the `PlayerInput` component on it in the game creates multiple independent players. Each player gets assigned devices for exclusive use by that player.

Note that 

#### Join players from a lobby

![Player Lobby](Images/HowDoI/PlayerLobby.gif)

```CSharp
// Enumerate all player currently in the game.
foreach (var player in playerInput.all)
   Debug.Log($"Player ...");
```

#### Spawn players

You can manually spawn new players using [`PlayerInput.Instantiate`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInput.html#UnityEngine_InputSystem_PlayerInput_Instantiate_XXX).

```CSharp
// Four players, each one on a gamepad.
PlayerInstantiate(playerPrefab, controlScheme: "Gamepad", Gamepad.all[0]);
PlayerInstantiate(playerPrefab, controlScheme: "Gamepad", Gamepad.all[1]);
PlayerInstantiate(playerPrefab, controlScheme: "Gamepad", Gamepad.all[2]);
PlayerInstantiate(playerPrefab, controlScheme: "Gamepad", Gamepad.all[3]);
```

#### Listen for joins


## Actions

### <a name="let-a-user-rebind-an-action-to-a-different-control"></a> ... let the user rebind an action to a different control?



### <a name="save-and-load-rebinds"></a> ... save and load rebinds?

Call [`SaveBindingOverridesAsJson`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputActionRebindingExtensions.html#UnityEngine_InputSystem_InputActionRebindingExtensions_SaveBindingOverridesAsJson_UnityEngine_InputSystem_IInputActionCollection2_) to create a string containing all rebinds for the given set of actions and [`LoadBindingOverridesFromJson`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputActionRebindingExtensions.html#UnityEngine_InputSystem_InputActionRebindingExtensions_LoadBindingOverridesFromJson_UnityEngine_InputSystem_IInputActionCollection2_System_String_System_Boolean_) to restore rebinds from such a string.

```CSharp
void SaveUserRebinds(PlayerInput player)
{
    var rebinds = player.actions.SaveBindingOverridesAsJson();
    PlayerPrefs.SetString("rebinds", rebinds);
}

void LoadUserRebinds(PlayerInput player)
{
    var rebinds = PlayerPrefs.GetString("rebinds");
    player.actions.LoadBindingOverridesFromJson(rebinds);
}
```

## Keyboards

### <a name="have-two-players-use-the-same-keyboard"></a> ... have two players use the same keyboard?

[`PlayerInput`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInput.html) will, by default, not assign two players to the same device. However, you can manually switch/spawn players .

1. Create separate control schemes for
    ![SplitKeyboard](Images/HowDoI/SplitKeyboard.gif)
2. Spawn players using the control schemes or switch existing players to them.
    ```CSharp
    // Spawn two players. One using WASD and one using arrows.
    PlayerInput.Instantiate(playerPrefab, controlScheme: "KeyboardWASD", pairWithDevice: Keyboard.current);
    PlayerInput.Instantiate(playerPrefab, controlScheme: "KeyboardArrows", pairWithDevice: Keyboard.current);
   
    // Alternatively, switch existing players.
    PlayerInput.all[0].SwitchCurrentControlScheme("KeyboardWASD", Keyboard.current);
    PlayerInput.all[1].SwitchCurrentControlScheme("KeyboardArrows", Keyboard.current);
    ```

## Testing

### <a name="create-mock-input-in-an-automated-test"></a> ... create mock input in an automated test?

![Automated Tests](Images/HowDoI/AutomatedTests.gif)

1. Create a test assembly and add references for `UnityEngine.InputSystem` and `UnityEngine.InputSystem.TestFramework`.
2. Add `com.unity.inputsystem` to `testables` in your project's `manifest.json` file.

```CSharp
// InputTestFixture isolates input for testing. No devices and no input from the host machine.
// Automatically cleans up any input-related setup put in place by a test.
class Tests : InputTestFixture
{
   [Test] // Works with [Test] and [UnityTest].
   public void Test()
   {
      // Can add devices here or in setup. Whatever we add to or register with the
      // input system will be removed after the test has finished.
      var mouse = InputSystem.AddDevice<Mouse>();

      // Move the mouse.
      Set(mouse.position, new Vector2(123, 234));

      // Can also step input manually in tests. In a [UnityTest], this
      // happens automatically whenever Unity advances by a frame.
      InputSystem.Update();
   }
}
```

More info in the [docs](Testing.md).

### <a name="set-an-actions-value-programmatically"></a> ... set an action's value programmatically?

Actions need to be bound to controls. They do not have values by themselves.

You can create a [`InputDevice`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputDevice.html) automatically from an [`InputActionAsset`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputActionAsset.html) using the following function. This creates controls on the device that mirror the actions found in the asset.

```CSharp
// Take a set of actions and create an InputDevice for it that has a control
// for each of the actions. Also binds the actions to that those controls.
public static InputDevice SetUpMockInputForActions(InputActionAsset actions)
{
  var layoutName = actions.name;

  // Build a device layout that simply has one control for each action in the asset.
  InputSystem.RegisterLayoutBuilder(() =>
  {
      var builder = new InputControlLayout.Builder()
          .WithName(layoutName);

      foreach (var action in actions)
      {
          builder.AddControl(action.name) // Must not have actions in separate maps with the same name.
              .WithLayout(action.expectedControlType);
      }

      return builder.Build();
  }, name: layoutName);

  // Create the device.
  var device = InputSystem.AddDevice(layoutName);

  // Add a control scheme for it to the actions.
  actions.AddControlScheme("MockInput")
      .WithRequiredDevice($"<{layoutName}>");

  // Bind the actions in the newly added control scheme.
  foreach (var action in actions)
      action.AddBinding($"<{layoutName}>/{action.name}", groups: "MockInput");

  // Restrict the actions to bind only to our newly created
  // device using the bindings we just added.
  actions.bindingMask = InputBinding.MaskByGroup("MockInput");
  actions.devices = new[] { device };

  return device;
}
```

Using this function, you can, for example, do:

```CSharp
var mockInput = SetUpMockInputForActions(actions);
Press((ButtonControl)mockInput["fire"]);
```
