### <a name="set-up-input-in-a-blank-project"></a>... set up input in a blank project?

1. Install the input system package through the Unity Package Manager as per [the documentation](Installation.md).
   ![Installation](Images/HowDoI/Installation.gif)
   This adds the [`UnityEngine.InputSystem`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.html) API to your project and enables support for it in the native Unity runtime.<br><br>
2. Add a [`PlayerInput`](Components.md#playerinput-component) to a `GameObject`.
   ![Add Player](Images/HowDoI/AddPlayer.gif)
   This adds an [`.inputactions`](ActionAssets.md) asset to your project and sets up one player in the game to use those actions.<br><br>
3. Read input from the actions in script.
   ![Read Input](Images/HowDoI/ReadInput.gif)
   ```CSharp
   public class CharacterController : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public InputActionReference fire;
       public InputActionReference move;

       public void Update()
       {
           if (fire.action.WasPressedThisFrame())
               Fire();

           var moveVector = move.action.ReadValue<Vector2>();
           Move(moveVector);
       }

       //...
   }
   ```
   There are other ways in which input from the actions can be consumed. For details, see the documentation for [`PlayerInput`](Components.md#playerinput-component) and [actions](Actions.md).

////TODO: problem: above script doesn't work as is for local multiplayer

### <a name="set-up-ugui-to-work-with-the-input-system"></a> ... set up uGUI to work with the input system?

Go to the `EventSystem` object and click the "Replace with InputSystemUIInputModule" button. Optionally, to use your own bindings instead of the default ones, drag your custom `.inputactions` asset into the `Actions Asset` field.

![Setup UI](Images/HowDoI/SetupUI.gif)

This will set up uGUI to receive events generated from input defined in an [`.inputactions`](ActionAssets.md) asset. If needed, you can customize the bindings.

### <a name="keep-using-the-old-input-system-alongside-the-new-one"></a> ... keep using the old input system alongside the new one?

After [installation](Installation.md), set `Active Input Handling` in `Player Preferences` to `Both`.

![Use Old and New](Images/HowDoI/UseOldAndNew.gif)

### <a name="have-multiple-local-players-in-my-game"></a> ... have multiple local players in my game?

Each [`PlayerInput`](Components.md#playerinput-component) represents one player. Having more than one `GameObject` with the `PlayerInput` component on it in the game automatically creates multiple independent players. Each player TODO............................

![Player Lobby](Images/HowDoI/PlayerLobby.gif)

```CSharp
// Enumerate all player currently in the game.
foreach (var player in playerInput.all)
   Debug.Log($"Player ...");
```

----------------

### <a name="let-a-user-rebind-an-action-to-a-different-control"></a> ... let the user rebind an action to a different control?



### <a name="save-and-load-rebinds"></a> ... save and load rebinds?

Call [`SaveBindingOverridesAsJson`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputActionRebindingExtensions.html#UnityEngine_InputSystem_InputActionRebindingExtensions_SaveBindingOverridesAsJson_UnityEngine_InputSystem_IInputActionCollection2_) to create a string containing all rebinds for the given set of actions and [`LoadBindingOverridesFromJson`](../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputActionRebindingExtensions.html#UnityEngine_InputSystem_InputActionRebindingExtensions_LoadBindingOverridesFromJson_UnityEngine_InputSystem_IInputActionCollection2_System_String_System_Boolean_) to restore rebinds from such a string.

```CSharp
void SaveUserRebinds(PlayerInput player)
{
    var rebinds = player.actions.SaveBindingOverridesAsJson();
    PlayerPrefs.SetString("rebinds", rebinds);
}

void LoadUserRebinds(PlayerInput player)
{
    var rebinds = PlayerPrefs.GetString("rebinds");
    player.actions.LoadBindingOverridesFromJson(rebinds);
}
```

### <a name="create-mock-input-in-an-automated-test"></a> ... create mock input in an automated test?

![Automated Tests](Images/HowDoI/AutomatedTests.gif)

1. Create a test assembly and add references for `UnityEngine.InputSystem` and `UnityEngine.InputSystem.TestFramework`.
2. Add `com.unity.inputsystem` to `testables` in your project's `manifest.json` file.

```CSharp
// InputTestFixture isolates input for testing. No devices and no input from the host machine.
// Automatically cleans up any input-related setup put in place by a test.
class Tests : InputTestFixture
{
   [Test] // Works with [Test] and [UnityTest].
   public void Test()
   {
      // Can add devices here or in setup. Whatever we add to or register with the
      // input system will be removed after the test has finished.
      var mouse = InputSystem.AddDevice<Mouse>();

      // Move the mouse.
      Set(mouse.position, new Vector2(123, 234));

      // Can also step input manually in tests. In a [UnityTest], this
      // happens automatically whenever Unity advances by a frame.
      InputSystem.Update();
   }
}
```
